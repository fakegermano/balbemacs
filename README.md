# Balboa Emacs Configuration

.emacs init file for my custom configuration. It uses mainly use-package for configuration and some productivity related stuff.

Highly based on the [prelude](https://github.com/fakegermano/prelude) configuration, but way simpler.

To activate/install the configuration, just run the `install.sh` script (or copy/link the `dotemacs` file to the home directory).
